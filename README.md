# Corel Image Classification

This repository contains code for image classification using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The project includes multiple machine learning models for classification, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.
